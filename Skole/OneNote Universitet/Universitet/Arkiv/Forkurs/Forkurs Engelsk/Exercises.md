Fig 1: A schematic of an atrium in a restaurant. Three walkways are suspended from the roofs with rods welded to flanges screwed into place. A portion of the roof are made of glass, in which the flanges probably are fastened with nuts. The walkways are at different elevations.  
Fig 2: The figure shows a schematic of the method of suspending the walkways. The flanges are fastened into box beams running perpendicular of the roof trusses.

How to install a lightbulb

1. Choose a lightbulb: Make sure you choose a bulb that fits your need in terms of socket, wattage, technology and shape.
2. Gather tools: You'll probably need a screwdriver, ladder and battery powered light.
3. Prepare the installation: Switch off the breaker or remove cord from the wall socket.
4. Uninstall the old bulb: Remove any spreaders and obstacles. Make sure the old bulb had time to cool off before unscrewing.
5. Install the new bulb: Screw in the new bulb and replace any features.

When I'm fifty I hope I'm happy, healthy, and fit.  
My mother always forget stuff, jumps to conclussions, and enjoys the sun.  
You know you are in Bergen when you're feet are wet, people are smiling, and mountains locks your ego into place.  
If I'll ever get out of this mess, I promise I'll never break a promise, act bad and do the wrong thing.  
Three things I learned in high school that I'll always remember are to
 
Today we employ thousands of people engineering solutions turning wind into energy.  
Lowering our reliance on fossil fuels will ease the use of natural resources.  
Renewable energy reduces energy costs in the long term.  
Kinetic energy converts into electrical energy through a generator.  
Having a contraption utilizing fewer resources is best.
 
Today we engage thousands of people engineering solutions turning wind into energy.  
Reducing our reliance on fossil fuels will ease the use of natural resources.  
Renewable energy consumes a great deal of valuable resources.  
Kinetic energy transfers into electrical energy through a generator.  
Having a contraption exploiting fewer resources is best.
 
Advantages of wind turbines:  
Wind turbines provide clean energy while keeping a low operational cost.  
Deployment of wind farms may revitalizing rural economies where wind is abundant.  
Such wind farms should recieve fewer subsidies than other type of technology.  
A huge benefit is the conservation of water resources.  
Though, a huge fluctuation in wind may lead to less price stability.ï¿¼Wind turbines must not harm local wildlife.
 
Rare mineral resources are expensive; hence we are determined to increase the efficiency.  
Erosion of the ground may lead to fatal accidents.  
Wind turbines have a major aesthetic impact on the horizion in otherwise untouched nature.  
Unpredictable operational circumstances are hard to overcome.
