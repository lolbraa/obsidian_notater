    - extension/elongation
    - Tensile strength
- Compression (crushing)
    
    - Compressive strength
- Deform (change shape)
- Plasticity
    
    - Can change their shape significantly but do not return to their original shape
    - Plastic: A malleable material: that can be plastically deformed (like lead)
    - Ductile: A material that can be stretched into a long length (copper)
- Elasticity
    
    - Extend, but still return to their original shape.
    - Like rubber can be elastically deformed to a considerable extent
    - Stiff: Low elasticity and strong (iron)
    - Brittle: Low elasticity and is weak (glass)

- Elastic limit: The limit up to where the material will og back to original shape
- Yield point:
- Ultimate Tensile Strength: The maximum tensile strength before it fractures.
- Rupture point: The point at which the material breaks
