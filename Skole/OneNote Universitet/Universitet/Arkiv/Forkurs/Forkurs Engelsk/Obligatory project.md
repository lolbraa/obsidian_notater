Nuclear energy - small modular reactors  
Introduction:

- Problemstilling: Er SMR løsningen på det fremtidige energibehovet?
    
    - History: We're dependent on energy, fossil fuels
    - Environment: We're in the middle of a global warming crisis, which mainly is caused by our need of energy. Is SMR a solution that:
        
        1. is safe for the environment.
        2. can replace todays energy-solutions.
    - Safety-concerns and political landscape
    - Economics: How does SMR fare against conventional, well-established methods in terms of
        
        1. Costs of manufacturing, deployment and maintenance
        2. The social dilemmas like pollution, fear against nuclear disasters
        3. Costs of not making it out of the global warming crisis; the savings SMR may bring.

SMR in a nutshell
 
Pros and cons

- Pros:
    
    - CO2-free, environment friendly
    - Modular = produced at a factory and shipped to site. Makes it way cheaper and faster to deploy (1)
    - Flexible poweroutput: the cost of turning on/off isn't as bad as fossil fuels (?)
        
        - Multiple reactors together, easily expandable and maintained without complete downtime
    - Can be deployed "everywhere": in a local/rural community (2,5)
        
        - May be connected to existing plants, expanding their capability and cutting emissions
        - Important fascilities, requiring no downtime, may have small reactors as a backup source (5)
        - Backup
    - Safer than conventional nuclear sites because of passive safety systems. (1)
        
        - Safety system: Shuts down and cools autonomously. Can be built mostly underground for resiliency against weather. (5)
    - The "fix" for nuclear instead of the conventional method
        
        - A new look at an old technology.
        - More compact, flexible, mobile, safer and cheaper.
 
- Cons:
    
    - Produces more nuclear waste than normal: hard and expensive to handle, takes millions of years to dissolve in nature (10)
    - the risk of nuclear accident and long regulatory processes
 
What does the future hold?

Jacopo Buongiorno, a nuclear-engineering professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has calculated that over the life cycle of power plants, which includes construction, mining, transport, operation, decommissioning and disposal of waste, the greenhouse-gas emissions for nuclear power are 1/700th those of coal, 1/400th of gas, and one-fourth of solar. Nuclear also requires 1/2,000th as much land as wind and around 1/400th as much as solar. For any given power output, the amount of raw material used to build a nuclear plant is a small fraction of an equivalent solar or wind farm. Although nuclear waste is obviously more difficult to dispose of, its volume is 1/10,000th that of solar and 1/500th of wind. This includes abandoned infrastructure and all the toxic substances that end up in landfills. One person’s lifetime use of nuclear power would produce about a half-ounce of waste. Even including the Chernobyl disaster, human mortality from coal is 2,000 to 3,000 times that of nuclear, while oil claims 400 times as many lives.
