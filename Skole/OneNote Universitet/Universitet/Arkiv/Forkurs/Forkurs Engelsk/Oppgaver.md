2.2  
A The automobile
 
B

1. The automobile: A group of mechanised vehicle with its own powertrain usually with seats for 2-7 people, with its own infrastructure of road and fueling. It changed the way of individual transportation by its speed and safety and convenience.
2. The Apollo missions to the Moon: NASA's space missions to transport and land men on the moon. It uprooted the convention of people being stuck at earth.
3. Power generation: The ability to transform power from one source to another. This has made us able to harness the energy we have all around us.
4. Agricultural mechanization: Using machines to manipulate the land for food. By mechanising the agriculture we've freed up a great part of the population from working in the fields, lifted a lot of people out of starvation and

3.1  
A

1. Mechanical engineers use all kinds of materials like alloys of cobber, aluminium, iron, etc
2. Different materials have different properties like elasticity, rigidity, ductility, etc

B

1. Sheets of plastic, because of it flexibility and
2. H-beams of iron, because of its stiffness
3. Wire of copper, since it leads electricity well
4. A aeroplane-wing of an alloy including aluminium, hence it's lightweight and elastic but strong
5. Spring made of a rigid but elastic alloy for that shock-absorbing effect
6. Belt of rubber since it hold up well and is flecible
7. Bridge of mainly steel since it needs to hold

B - 2  
The lecturer says it is vital to know what materials there are and when they should be utilised, because over- or underengineering may be expensive or fatal.
 
B - 3  
I would take notes by the topics he goes through.
   

C - 1  
The main idea is to describes the laws of nature affecting materials.
 
C - 2  
Stress is the measure in materials as they react upon other forces.
 
C - 3  
Newton third law of motion: For every force, there are equal and opposite reactions. The ideal state is equilibrium.

The cable was so long that we had to cut it in half.  
Scarcely had the project began when we had to shut down.  
The calculations are such hard that I had to get help.  
No sooner had it been certified than the bridge collapsed.  
As often as you like.  
I'm uncertain whether or not to hire you.  
The job is not only hard but also time-demanding.  
You would think this is neither easy nor hard.  
Either one of us have to og.  
Both of us are used to biscuits and cream.
