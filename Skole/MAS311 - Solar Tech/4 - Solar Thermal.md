## Radiative power in watts
$$
P_{RAD} = q [W/m^2] * A [m^2]
$$

## Thermal power in watts
$$
P_{Th} = C_{p} * \dot{m} * \nabla T 
$$
Heat capacity
$$
C_{p} \left[ \frac{J}{kg * K} \right]
$$
Mass flow rate
$$
\dot{m} \left[ \frac{kg}{\sec} \right]
$$

## Convective Heat loss
Loss through radiation and convection
Convective heat loss rate in watts:
$$
q_{c} = u_{t}A(T_{c} - T_{a})
$$

# Vacuum tube collector
Better efficiency, but way more expensive and fragile.

# Direct Absorption Solar Collectors
Solar radiation is heating the liquid directly.
- Dye or suspended particles
- Nanofluids
	- Hard to be stable; sinks/clogs
