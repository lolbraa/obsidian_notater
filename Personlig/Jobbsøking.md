# Notater
## CERN
- We know the area from visiting before; looking forward to hiking the mountains, and seeing the nearby towns.


For my working life, I aspire to find a workplace where I can contribute to society by doing difficult, meaningful and inspiring work. I believe I’ve found the perfect workplace in CERN, a culmination of those attributes, while also being a safe place to grow and master my subject. It would truly be a great privilege to join you in Geneve.

Let me tell you about myself. I’m a nerd who’s happy to spend my freetime tinkering with projects, when not enjoying my family or hiking mountains.

In the past I’ve worked as an electrician and an audio engineer. The former has led me to thrive in my current bachelors programme, as we learn to master electrical circuits by the manupilation of audio.

Though I seldom have time to complete my projects, I’ve made USB-DMX-controller for professional lightning, serial-controller using FPGA/VHDL, and currently co-designing a fully functional 8 bit CPU of only 2n7000-MOSFETs with fellow students.

The past year my homelab cluster has seen most attention, deploying  a vast variety of containers/programs, programming my own scripts and projects, and experimenting with hardware like LicheeRV (RISC-V) and Raspberry Pi. Surprisingly, this led me to convert from Windows to Linux as the daily driver for both desktop and laptop.

Besides school and hobby, I work with my brother and a friend. We specialise in hosting websites and gameservers, though my contributions has been mostly infrastructure (networking, backups and containaritazion) and backend-coding API-implementations

I’ve spent much time . , soldering, and watching niche youtube videos of unique projects. , thrive on learning through experimentation, and love to learn through other peoples projects online and in person.
