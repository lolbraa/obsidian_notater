Throughout my career, I aspire to contribute to society by doing challenging and meaningful work. I believe CERN is the ideal workplace, and it would be a great privilege to join you in Geneva.

Allow me to introduce myself.

As a father of two great kids, a newborn and a three-year-old, I enjoy spending my time playing or hiking in the mountains – or tinkering with projects. Though I seldom have time to see projects through, I’ve made a USB-DMX controller, a serial controller using FPGA/VHDL, and I am currently co-designing a functional 8-bit CPU using 2N7000 MOSFETs with fellow students. However, my homelab has seen the most attention lately, deploying various containers and experimenting with hardware like LicheeRV (RISC-V) and Raspberry Pi. Surprisingly, this experience led me to switch from Windows to Linux.

My background includes working as an electrician and an audio engineer. Both has led me to thrive in my current bachelor’s program, as we master electrical theory through practical audio circuits. 

Additionally, I have a side business with my brother and a friend, specializing in websites and game hosting. My contributions include infrastructure management (networking, backups, and containerization) and backend coding, such as custom API implementations.

My family and I hope the next chapter of our lives includes a year in the beautiful city of Geneva.
