Good morning
This is the husband of Nora talking on her behalf.
We recieved this shipment at our local post office, but my wife being pregnant in later stages and stressed about exams, she missed/forgot the delivery note. It's really frustrating and we can't really afford new products, so we're really hopeful you can help us by resending the packages. 
Off course we'll pay the new shipping-fees and can do a handling fee. 

Thank you in advance

Kristoffer
